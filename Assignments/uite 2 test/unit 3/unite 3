# Boolean Expressions
# Kinda like a mathematical Formula
# 14 + 10 = 24
# can only evaluate True or False 
# 5 > 10 = False    Boolean Algebra uses comparison operators
# > < >= <= == !=
print(14 + 10) # Algebra
print(5 > 10) # Boolean Algebra

x = 5                # set x equal to 5, tell it what to be 
print(x == 5)        # Get x equal 5, ask a question

# This is the PERFECT test question
# what is the difference between = and ==?

print(4 >= 2)           # True
print(1993 == 1993)     # True
print(-90 < -99)        # False
print(10 != 10)         # False,  "not"
